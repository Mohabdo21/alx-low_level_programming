1.  **_strcmp(const char *str1, const char *str2)**: This function compares two strings character by character. It keeps incrementing the pointers `str1` and `str2` as long as the characters they point to are equal and not the null character. When it encounters a pair of characters that are not equal or the end of one of the strings, it returns the difference between the ASCII values of the characters pointed to by `str1` and `str2`.

2.  **get_card_value_index(const char *value)**: This function takes a card value as input and returns its index in the `values` array. It iterates over the `values` array and compares each element with the input value using the `_strcmp` function. If it finds a match, it returns the index. If it doesn't find a match, it returns -1.

3.  **distribute_cards(deck_node_t **deck, deck_node_t *buckets[NUM_SUITS][NUM_VALUES], deck_node_t *tail[NUM_SUITS][NUM_VALUES])**: This function distributes the cards in the deck into buckets based on their suit and value. It iterates over the deck and for each card, it gets the index of its value using the `get_card_value_index` function. It then places the card in the corresponding bucket. If the bucket is empty, it sets the card as the first and last card in the bucket. If the bucket is not empty, it adds the card to the end of the bucket.

4.  **collect_and_relink_cards(deck_node_t **deck, deck_node_t *buckets[NUM_SUITS][NUM_VALUES], deck_node_t *tail[NUM_SUITS][NUM_VALUES])**: This function collects the cards from the buckets and relinks them to form the sorted deck. It iterates over the buckets in the order of suits and values. For each non-empty bucket, it adds the cards in the bucket to the end of the deck.

5.  **sort_deck(deck_node_t **deck)**: This is the main function that initiates the sorting of the deck. It checks if the deck is null or contains less than 2 cards, if so, it returns without doing anything. If the deck contains 2 or more cards, it calls the `distribute_cards` function to distribute the cards into buckets and then the `collect_and_relink_cards` function to collect the cards from the buckets and form the sorted deck.
