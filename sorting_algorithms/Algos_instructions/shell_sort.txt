It works by comparing elements that are a certain distance apart, rather than adjacent elements. This distance between the elements being compared is called the "gap".

The Knuth sequence is a specific sequence of gaps that is used in the Shell sort algorithm. The sequence is generated by the formula `gap = gap * 3 + 1`, starting with `gap = 1`. The sequence continues until the gap is larger than the size of the array.

Here's how the `shell_sort` function works, step by step:

1.  **Calculate the gap**: The function starts by calculating the largest gap that is smaller than the size of the array using the Knuth sequence.

2.  **Sort the elements**: The function then enters a loop that continues until the gap is 0. In each iteration of the loop, the gap is divided by 3.

3.  **Compare and swap**: For each gap, the function goes through the array and compares each element with the element `gap` places behind it. If the current element is smaller, it swaps places with the element `gap` places behind it. This process continues until the element is in its correct place according to the current gap.

4.  **Print the array**: After each pass with a certain gap, the function prints the current state of the array.

5.  **Repeat**: The function repeats steps 3 and 4 for each gap in the Knuth sequence, until the gap is 0. At this point, the array is fully sorted.
