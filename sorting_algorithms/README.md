    - Quick Sort - Hoare Partition scheme
- Understand how to select the most efficient sorting algorithm for a given input.
- Learn the concept of a stable sorting algorithm.

## More Information

For this project, we are provided with the following functions:

- print_array.c
- print_list.c

Our header file, sort.h, will contain all the function prototypes and data structures.

## Implemented Algorithms
